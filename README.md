# ds3010project
Accumulating final project for ds 3010

Hello! This is our project, and these are some <br /> 
instructions with what to do with it.

Data & preliminary steps
- Our data was too big to put in github, but it can <br /> 
be downloaded from our google drive folder (linked)
  
- Once you have these 4 csv files in the data<br /> 
package/folder you can run data_processing.ipynd
  
- This file NEEDS to be run first

Analysis and more <br /> 
Run:
- data_exploration.ipynb for some graphs and our <br /> 
  correlation matrix
  
- test_models.ipynb for the normal linear regression<br /> 
model (most successful and simplest)
  
- regression.ipynb for our attempts at Lasso and <br /> 
Elastic Net regression
